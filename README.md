Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of various data science tools, including data filtering and heatmap generation with Python, interactive web application development with Shiny, and figure creation and adjustment with Inkscape.

Python (task 2) 
The Python section covers the general use of Python for filtering and modifying data, as well as generating relevant plots based on the input data.

Shiny Web Application (task 3)
The Shiny web application, "Bar Plot Generator with Mean and SEM," facilitates the automatic generation of bar plots by simply adding your data triplicates. The generated graphs have consistent features, and any required graphical changes can be made by modifying the code. In the provided example, the graph displays the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) of Glut-1, a glucose transporter in murine CD8 T cells. This parameter can be adapted for different plots.

Inkscape (Task 4)
The Inkscape section includes several figures that have been adjusted according to specific requirement, which showcases the usefulness of this tool to modify uploaded graphs.

Features
Shiny Web App: Interface for data visualization.
Python data manipulation and Heatmap Generation: creation of heatmaps from given datasets.
Inkscape Integration: Tools and guidelines for adjusting and enhancing visual elements using Inkscape.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have R installed along with the Shiny package.
Python: Ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries, Google colab was used here.
Inkscape: Download and install Inkscape as well as "Scientific" in Extensions.
